    questions: [
      {
        q: "What is a workplace wellbeing audit?",
        a: "A workplace wellbeing audit is a comprehensive assessment of your organization's psychosocial work environment. We survey and interview your staff, analyze the data using both human expertise and AI technology, and provide a detailed report with actionable recommendations aligned with ISO 45003 standards."
      },
      {
        q: "How is your Human+AI approach different?",
        a: "Our approach combines Craig's 20+ years of expertise with AI analysis to identify patterns and insights that might be missed by traditional methods. The AI helps process large amounts of data efficiently, while human expertise ensures recommendations are practical, culturally appropriate, and implementable."
      },
      {
        q: "What is ISO 45003 and why does it matter?",
        a: "ISO 45003 is the international standard for managing psychosocial risks at work. It provides guidelines for identifying and managing factors that can affect mental health and wellbeing. Alignment with ISO 45003 demonstrates your commitment to employee wellbeing and helps ensure compliance with workplace health and safety regulations."
      },
      {
        q: "How long does a wellbeing audit take?",
        a: "Typically, the entire process takes 3-4 weeks from start to finish: 1 week for setup and survey deployment, 1-2 weeks for data collection, and 1 week for analysis and report preparation. Larger organizations may require additional time."

  {
    category: "Process & Methodology",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What happens during the audit process?",
        a: "The process includes: 1) Initial consultation to understand your needs, 2) Anonymous employee surveys and targeted interviews, 3) Data analysis using our Human+AI methodology, 4) Comprehensive report with findings and recommendations, 5) Presentation of results and discussion of next steps."
      },
      {
        q: "How do you ensure employee confidentiality?",
        a: "All survey responses are completely anonymous and aggregated. We never share individual responses with employers, only overall patterns and trends. Interview data is also anonymized and grouped thematically. We require minimum response numbers before reporting on any demographic group to protect identity."
      },
      {
        q: "What kind of questions are in the survey?",
        a: "Our surveys assess key psychosocial factors including workload, control, support, relationships, role clarity, and change management. Questions are evidence-based and aligned with HSE Management Standards and ISO 45003 guidelines."
      },
      {
        q: "Can we customize the survey for our organization?",
        a: "Yes, while we have core questions that enable benchmarking and ensure comprehensive coverage, we can add organization-specific questions to address your particular concerns or context."

    ]
  },
  {
    category: "Pricing & Packages",
    questions: [

      },
      {
        q: "Can you help present findings to our board?",

        q: "Do we need to prepare our employees?",

      {
        q: "What if we're not ready to implement changes?",
        a: "Understanding your current state is valuable even if you can't implement all recommendations immediately. The audit provides a baseline for future improvements and helps you prioritize where to focus limited resources for maximum impact."
