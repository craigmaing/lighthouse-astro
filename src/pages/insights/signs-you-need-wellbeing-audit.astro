            Employee wellbeing issues rarely announce themselves with fanfare. Instead, they manifest as subtle shifts in workplace dynamics, creeping increases in absence figures, and gradual declines in performance. By the time these issues become obvious, they're often deeply embedded and expensive to address.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here are seven warning signs that indicate your organisation would benefit from a professional wellbeing audit.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Rising Absence Rates</h2>
          
          <p>
            <strong>The Sign:</strong> Your absence rates have increased by more than 10% over the past year, particularly short-term absences of 1-3 days.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Short-term, frequent absences often indicate stress, burnout, or disengagement rather than genuine physical illness. The UK average is 7.8 days per employee per year – if you're significantly above this, particularly with mental health-related absence, it's time to investigate.
          </p>

          <Card variant="bordered" class="my-6">
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-0">
              <strong>Red Flag:</strong> If Monday and Friday absences are disproportionately high, this suggests presenteeism and disengagement rather than genuine illness.
            </p>
          </Card>

          <h2>2. Increased Staff Turnover</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>The Sign:</strong> Your voluntary turnover rate exceeds 15% annually, or you're seeing departures of previously engaged, high-performing employees.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> The cost of replacing an employee ranges from 50% to 200% of their annual salary. When good people leave, they're often escaping something – usually stress, poor management, or lack of support. Exit interviews rarely reveal the full truth.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Declining Engagement Scores</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>The Sign:</strong> Your employee engagement scores have dropped, participation in voluntary activities has decreased, or you're struggling to get responses to employee surveys.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Engagement is the canary in the coal mine for wellbeing issues. Disengaged employees are 87% more likely to leave and cost organisations up to 34% of their salary in lost productivity.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Visible Stress Indicators</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>The Sign:</strong> You're noticing increased conflicts between team members, more complaints about workload, or changes in workplace atmosphere.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> These behavioural changes are often the first visible signs of systemic wellbeing issues. When stress becomes normalised, it creates a toxic culture that's difficult to reverse without intervention.
          </p>

          <Card variant="gradient" class="my-6">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-navy-800 mb-3">Common Stress Indicators Include:</h3>
            <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-700">
              <li>• Increased irritability and conflicts</li>
              <li>• Reduced collaboration between teams</li>
              <li>• More grievances and complaints</li>
              <li>• Cynicism about company initiatives</li>
              <li>• Physical symptoms (headaches, fatigue) being discussed openly</li>
            </ul>
          </Card>

          <h2>5. Performance Metrics Declining</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>The Sign:</strong> Productivity metrics are slipping, quality issues are increasing, or customer satisfaction scores are declining without obvious external factors.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Poor wellbeing directly impacts cognitive function, decision-making, and attention to detail. Studies show that employees with poor mental health are 35% less productive.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Recent Organisational Changes</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>The Sign:</strong> You've undergone restructuring, rapid growth, leadership changes, or shifted to hybrid working without assessing the impact on employees.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Change is a major psychosocial hazard. Even positive changes like growth can create stress if not managed properly. Post-change wellbeing assessments are crucial for identifying and addressing emerging issues.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Compliance and Legal Concerns</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>The Sign:</strong> You've had stress-related grievances, are concerned about HSE compliance, or want to align with ISO 45003 standards.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> UK law requires employers to assess and manage stress risks. Failure to do so can result in enforcement action, compensation claims, and reputational damage. Proactive assessment demonstrates due diligence.
          </p>

          <h2>The Hidden Costs of Waiting</h2>

          <p>
            Many organisations wait until problems become critical before addressing wellbeing. This reactive approach is costly:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Presenteeism</strong> (employees working while unwell) costs UK businesses £15.1 billion annually</li>
            <li><strong>Mental health issues</strong> account for 12.8 million lost working days</li>
            <li><strong>Stress-related turnover</strong> can cost up to £30,000 per departure for professional roles</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When to Act</h2>

          <p>
            If you recognise two or more of these warning signs, it's time for a professional wellbeing audit. The earlier you identify and address issues, the easier and less costly they are to resolve.
          </p>

          <p>
            A comprehensive wellbeing audit doesn't just identify problems – it provides a roadmap for improvement, helps you prioritise interventions, and gives you baseline metrics to measure progress.
          </p>

          <div class="bg-amber-50 p-6 rounded-lg mt-8 border-l-4 border-amber-400">
            <h3 class="text-navy-900 mb-3 font-semibold">Prevention is Better Than Cure</h3>
            <p class="mb-0">
              The best time for a wellbeing audit isn't when problems are obvious – it's before they develop. Regular assessments help you maintain a healthy workplace culture and catch issues while they're still manageable.
            </p>
